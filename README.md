Hello there! I'm a budding Cyber Security enthusiast, currently deep in the trenches of learning all about the fascinating world of cybersecurity. As a student, I'm immersing myself in various aspects of this field, constantly seeking out challenges and opportunities to expand my skill set.

## About Me üìö

I'm on a journey to understand the intricacies of cyber security, from the ground up. My GitHub space here is primarily a collection of notes, projects, and experiments that I've undertaken as part of my learning process. I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and resources, hoping that they might assist others on their learning path as well.

## My Pentest Project üõ°Ô∏è

One of the cornerstone projects of my training involved conducting a penetration test within a controlled sandbox environment. This project was a hands-on experience that allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge in real-world scenarios, simulating an attacker's approach to understanding and exploiting vulnerabilities within a system.

### Key Highlights:

- **Reverse Shells**: Gained practical experience in establishing reverse shells, understanding the mechanism behind maintaining stealthy control over compromised systems.
- **Proxychains**: Leveraged proxychains to obscure my attacks, routing through multiple proxies to conceal my location and evade detection.
- **Pivoting**: Mastered the art of pivoting, using compromised systems to launch attacks on other targets within the network, effectively demonstrating the importance of network segmentation.
- **Ping Sweeps**: Conducted ping sweeps to map out live systems within the network, identifying potential targets for further exploration and exploitation.
- **Automation Tools**:
  - **LinPEAS**: Utilized LinPEAS for automated privilege escalation and system enumeration, streamlining the process of identifying vulnerabilities.
  - **Metasploit**: Employed Metasploit, a powerful framework for exploiting vulnerabilities, further enriching my understanding of various exploit techniques and payloads.

## My Learning Philosophy üå±

I believe in the hands-on approach to learning, where making mistakes is just another step towards mastery. The projects and notes you'll find here are a testament to this journey, reflecting both successes and learning opportunities.
